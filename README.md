# Django- Face Recognition
## An AI service that analyzes faces in images
#### Apply facial recognition for a range of scenarios Detect, identify, and analyze faces in images. 


## Introduction
This project aims :
-To classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).
-Check the likelihood that two faces belong to the same person and receive a confidence score.
-Check if a person is wearing a mask or not.
-Detecting attributes belonging to a face. Example attributes are the color of hair, hairstyle, age, gender, etc.
